⚡ Fun fact: The concept of "tree" is not only fundamental in nature but also in computer science. In nature, you have trees with branches, leaves, and a hierarchical structure. In computer science, a "tree" is a data structure composed of nodes with branches, mirroring the hierarchical structure found in nature.
